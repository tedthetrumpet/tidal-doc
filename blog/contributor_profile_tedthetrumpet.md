## Tidal Contributions
**How do you contribute to Tidal Cycles? What have you worked on?**

I'm a musician not a developer, so I'm not really able to 'contribute' in the sense of code! However, I have made some [gamelan sample banks](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/nmsamples) available, asked (hopefully useful) questions on forums, taught Tidal at [my institution](https://pure.rcs.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/j-simon-van-der-walt(449d6ab3-50fe-4a02-bc83-76e1f88b2769).html), and initiated the [Floating Gold](http://www.nagamas.co.uk/floatinggold/) project that used MiniTidal in [Estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary).
